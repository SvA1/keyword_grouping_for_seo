# keyword_grouping_for_seo
Here is a basic algorithm for grouping essential words by necessary topics. Don't think anybody would need it but anyway..the first
working code I got.

1.Type the list of words (every word in a seperate cell) in Excel you want to group

2.Type in the opposite cell the required topic to each word

3.Run the code and get the sorted list in "words2.txt"
