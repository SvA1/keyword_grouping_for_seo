# keyword_grouping_for_seo
Grouping essential words by topics. 
The first working code I got


1.Type the list of words you want to group (every word in a seperate cell) in an Excel file. 

2.Type in the opposite cell the required topic to each word.

3.Run the code and get the sorted list in "words2.txt".
